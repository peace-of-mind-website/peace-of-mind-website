# peace-of-mind-website
  The increasingly competitive and stressful nature of the Bay Area school and work life makes the topic of mental health more prevalent by the day. Despite this, there is still a strong social stigma surrounding it, causing people to feel uncomfortable when seeking out more information about it. This creates a close-minded and unsafe environment for those who are dealing with issues regarding their mental health.
	
  Our goal is to inform and educate ordinary people about mental illness and how to get involved in helping others, as well as provide useful health resources. We want to foster an environment where people with or without a mental illness can learn more, destress, and most importantly, feel safe and accepted. 
  
  As future goals, we would love to add a “contact us” entry form where people can submit questions and get to know more about us and how we created this website. We would also like to create a forum page where people could discuss mental health and ask for additional resources to get help. This would help combat the stigma surrounding mental health that plagues our society. Lastly, there are always ways to improve our existing pages and formatting, and we want to continue working on that, too.
  
  We used HMTL, CSS, and javascript to create this website, as well as the Pexels API, Google News and Events, and Spotify.

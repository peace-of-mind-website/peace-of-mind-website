  The increasingly competitive and stressful nature of the Bay Area school and work life makes the topic of mental health more prevalent by the day. Despite this, there is still a strong social stigma surrounding it, causing people to feel uncomfortable when seeking out more information about it. This creates a close-minded and unsafe environment for those who are dealing with issues regarding their mental health.
	
  Our goal is to inform and educate ordinary people about mental illness, as well as provide resources that help them destress. We want to foster an environment where people with or without a mental illness  can learn more, destress, and most importantly, feel safe and accepted. 
  
  We used HMTL, CSS, and javascript to create this website, as well as the Pexels API, Google News and Events, and Spotify.
